# Nature Index indicator for Wild Reindeer

Code developer: Bart Peeters - 22-04-2025

This repository contains the R code workflow and necessary data to calculate the [Nature Index (NI) indicator for wild reindeer](https://www.naturindeks.no/Indicators/villrein) in Norway. 
The original Jags output from integrated multi-population models (IMPM) are not included, but the output files from Step 1 are included in the `data` folder.
The IMPM is currently not published but based on the IPM by [Nilsen & Strand 2019 PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194566).

See `NI_villrein.Rmd` for the entire workflow and R code.
