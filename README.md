# Nature Index indicator for Wild Reindeer

Code developer: Bart Peeters - 22-04-2025

This repository contains the R code workflow and necessary data to calculate the NI indicator for wild reindeer in Norway. 
The original Jags output from integrated multi-population models (IMPM) are not included, but the output files from Step 1 are included in the `data` folder.

See `NI_villrein.Rmd` for the entire workflow and R code.
